Hi, I'm Ionu»õ Cristian Colceriu, a designer and web worker from Romania.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I started web development some time ago when Internet Explorer was the best browser around and we loved to use <code>filter</code>s, while struggling with Netscape Navigator 4.

In the last 10 years I've worked in graphic and print design, illustration, icon design, interface design but always kept a strong focus on the web, mostly on frontend development. 

In recent years I've been more involved with large-scale JavaScript web apps, and mobile development.

I'm passionate about free software and try to create both my code and graphics using free tools, like [Kate](http://kate-editor.org/) / [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) or [Krita](http://krita.org/).

In case you were wondering, *Ghinda* stands for *acorn*, in Romanian.
