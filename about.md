Hi, I'm Ionu»õ Cristian Colceriu, a designer and web worker from Romania.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Ghinda* (romanian for Acorn) is my personal website.

I started web development in the dark days when Internet Explorer was the best browser around and we loved to use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms532847(v=vs.85).aspx"><code>filter</code></a>, while struggling with Netscape Navigator 4.

During these years I've been working in graphic and print design, illustration, interface design but always kept a strong focus on frontend web development, the holy trinity of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've worked with most of the hip CMS's and JavaScript libraries around.

I'm passionate about free software and try to create both my code and graphics using free tools, like [Kate](http://kate-editor.org/) / [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) or [Krita](http://krita.org/).
